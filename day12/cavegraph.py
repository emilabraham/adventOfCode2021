# Find all paths through the cave
# First step is to create a Cave object: Cave(value, isSmall)
# Second step is to create a dictionary of each cave's connections { Cave.value: list(Cave)}
# Final step is to create a list of all paths through the cave
# How do I figure out when I've tried all possible paths?
# I think recursion might be the way to go?
